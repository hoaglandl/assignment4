          <h2>Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow</h2>
            <p>EPCOT is the second of four Disney theme parks built in Orlando, Florida. It initially opened in 1982 and stemmed from an original concept by Walt Disney himself. Walt's vision of a futuristic community was something he wanted included in the construction of the Disney World Resort, but it turned out to be another unique theme park instead.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, EPCOT is undergoing a redesign that will change the layout of the park. Individual "neighborhoods" are going to be situated at the entrance to compliment the popular and timeless World Showcase in the back of the park. The new neighborhoods will be called World Celebration, World Discovery, and World Nature, which will all feature unique shops, attractions, and more.</p>

            <p>The most popular part of EPCOT is probably the seasonal festivals that bring tasty foods, music, and art to the World Showcase Lagoon. During these festivals, guests can enjoy small portions of delicacies from all over the globe, as well as purchase some specialized merchandise for the occasion. The dates and lengths of these festivals vary year to year, but usually occur within the same seasons each year. </p>
            <br>
            <p>There are also attractions to enjoy all throughout the park. Most people may not know that the iconic EPCOT ball is actually an attraction itself. The ride inside the ball is called <span style="color:blue;font-size:20px">Spaceship Earth</span>, and it takes guests on a slow-moving journey through human history as we have interacted and evolved as a part of life on Earth. More thrilling attractions like Test Track can be found near the entrance, while other shows and performances related to the many countries EPCOT highlights can be found in World Showcase.</p>
